<!-- Overview:
The pup has to go! Take your dog outside and collect its poo. If your neighbors step in the poo before you collect it, you loose. If you collect all the poo your dog has to offer without any of your neighbors stepping in it, you win!

As a user, I want the ability to... 
  - Move around the neighborhood
  - Collect all the poo my dog has to offer
  - Collect all the poo before my neighbors collide with it
  - See my dog run around
  - See my dog lay his poo
  - See my dogs poo 
  - See my neighbors come outside
  - See my neighbors walk towards the poo spot
  - See the win screen when I have collected all my dogs poo
  - See a loose screen when my neighbors step in poo

function - gameloop - holds the entire logic that runs the game

function - dadMoves - used to move the dad around, should be attached to arrow or wasd keys

function - dogMoves - used to move dog to next (or random) false valued poo spot

function - dogGoes2 - activates when dog collides with false valued poo spot, calls pooCountDecrease(), pooApears(), dogMoves() and neighborWakes()

function - pooAppears - turns pooSpot's value to true

function - pooGone - turns pooSpot's value to false

function pooCountDecrease - -1 to poo count

function neighborWakes - creates neighbor sprite and calls neighborMoves()

function - neighborMoves - used to move the neighbor to poo spot 

function - neighborSteps - used to see if neighbor collided with true or false valued poo spot, calls (gameOverLoose() if true) and (neighborGoesBack() if false)

function - neighborGoesBack - used to send neighbor back home and calls byeNeighbor()

function byeNeighbor - used to remove neighbor when neighbor collides with front door

function - pooCollected - calls(scoreIncrease()) and (pooGone()) when player collides with true valued poo spot (possibly calls dogGoFast())

function - dogGoFast - adds 1 to dog speed (optional)
